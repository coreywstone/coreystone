                (now a sound engineer for movies – he did Frozen!) was the real computer wiz, but I 
                used MacDraw to draft putt-putt holes ⛳️ and skate ramps 🛹 to build. I'd spec out 
                the parts list and call for lumber prices. We built 2 ramps and no golf holes, but no

                We moved to Oklahoma in 10th grade, where I did gymnastics and played a lot of sand 
                volleyball and cards with friends. Academically, I did well in both creative and STEM, 
                but I wanted to do something art-related.

                My art teacher recommended the University of Kansas' Fine Arts program, and after 
                filling out the long paper application, I decided I didn't want to do that again, so 
                I went to KU. 💙❤️

                In the evenings, Nami and I also coached KU cheer from 2004-2015. At first, I listened 
                to a bunch of leadership books on my Cerner commute, which helped me create motivational 
                systems and a culture of excellence. Might have lost some hearing from Allen Fieldhouse though. 🏀🙉
