<h1>Squad Roles</h1>



<!--h3>Academics and Paperwork</h3>
<i>Ellen, Kent, Jed, Lauren, Mitch</i><br>
<ul style="margin-top: 3px; margin-bottom: 3px"></li>
<li>Help squad members with academic problems and questions by helping directly or referring them  to someone else who can help.</li>
<li>Coordinate with Cat to get paperwork, have squad members fill it out, then return it to her (you may want to designate a contact person for Cat)</li>
<li>Perform any squad votes.</li>
</ul>
-->

<!--h3>Academic Advisor: TBD</h3>
<p>The Academic Advisor helps squad members with academic problems and questions. He or she can either help directly or refer the person to someone else who can help.</p-->

<h4>Leadership team: Zach, Evan, Kaitlin, Anna, Taia, Kelly</h4>
<p>Captains and leaders should exemplify the squad's values and ideals; their attitude and work ethic should be a role model for how every squad member should act. A good test is to ask, &quot;if everyone had the same attitude and work ethic as the captains, how successful would the squad be?&quot; (Note that the captains' skill level is largely irrelevant.) Their responsibilities include:
</p><ul style="margin-top: 3px; margin-bottom: 3px">
<li>Help the coaches lead the squad, both vocally and by example.</li>
<li>If coaches aren't present, the captains will be in charge and should direct the squad.</li>
<li>Help solve problems within the squad before they become big problems.</li>
<li>Act as a liaison between coaches and squad members by a) informing coaches of potential conflicts and issues within the squad, and b) helping the squad understand the coaches' intentions.</li>
<li>Call stunts and pyramids on the field/court if the coach hasn't called them.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Equipment Managers: Guy Captains</h3>

<ul style="margin-top: 3px; margin-bottom: 3px"></li>
<li>Assist other squad members with their workout plans if they request it.</li>

<li>Help motivate and encourage other squad members to continually improve their fitness level.</li>
