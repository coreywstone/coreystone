<h1>Academics</h1>

<b>Our Academic Policy</b> (from the Spirit Squad Policy document):<br>

<p>All members must maintain a 2.0 GPA each semester and pass twelve hours each semester. Graduate students must maintain the prescribed load of courses pursuant to their program and maintain the 2.0 GPA.  Only 1 incomplete is permitted per semester to qualify for team membership and scholarship aid. This incomplete cannot be counted in the 12 hours that the student must pass each semester. A member may use summer or non-traditional sessions of transferable credit hours to boost his/her GPA to meet the minimum GPA requirement.  These courses must be completed and recorded on the member's transcript prior to the start of the following academic semester.  Class schedules will be checked with Student Services after the add/drop date, midterm and last day of school before holiday break. If any student has not complied with the grade requirements and/or the hours requirement, he/she is subject to benching, removal from the team and/or removal from participation in national competition or the post-season basketball season. This decision will be at the discretion of the coach, advisor, or Athletic Department.  Should the student's final grades reflect that he/she has not met the hours or grade requirement, the student shall be removed from the squad for the following semester.  Any plan for reinstatement shall be agreed upon by the student and the coach at the coach's discretion.</p>

<h3>My Advice</h3>
I strongly recommend that you do these simple things:
<ol>
<li>Go to all your classes</li>
<li>Sit near the front (so you're forced to listen)</li>
<li>Do the work the teacher asks you to do.</li>
</ol>

If you do these two things, your grades will be fine. <br><br>
