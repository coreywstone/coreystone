<h1>Uniforms</h1>

<h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>
<ul>
<li>Always fold your uniform! If you do, they won't wrinkle, and we're not going to cheer in wrinkled uniforms any more. 
<li>Don't lose your uniform or you'll be charged for it.
<li>If you have a problem with a uniform, see Cat. She must approve any alterations BEFORE they are done (hopefully, you'll be able to switch with someone rather than alter it).
<li>Turn in your uniforms quickly when you're asked to.
</ul>

<h2>Bow Colors</h2>
Unless otherwise specified, the bow colors are:<br><br>
<i>New Blue or Diagonal uniform</i> = White Bow<br>
<i>White uniform</i> = Red Bow<br> 
<i>Red/Blue uniform</i> = Blue Bow<br>
