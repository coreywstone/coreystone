<h1>Cheering KU Volleyball</h1>
<h4>Last updated: Aug 31, 2012</h4>

<h2>Where to Stand / Rules</h2>

<p>During the game, NCAA and Big 12 rules require us to always be on our team's side of the net, and stay out of the "serving area." Rules also state that we can never interact with opposing players or officials. Remember the hard-court stunt rules: no twisting; cupies must be spotted.</p>

<h2>Pre-Game</h2>
<ul>
<li>We do not have any locker room. Most of the time you can store your bag under the bleachers, which is of course not secure, so don't bring valuables into the game.</li>
<li>Pick up band chants and fight songs, etc.</li>
<li>The volleyball players will run out and around the court. Just spirit because you will pick up "I'm a" when the band starts it. Stay in the corners at this time (The players will be warming up and serving across the net.  Have a spotter (guy or girl) for all stunts to watch for balls).</li>
<li>The girls will be introduced and will throw a ball into the crowd. Stay in corners and clap and or spirit (No tunnel, just stay in corner)</li>
<li>National Anthem followed by the Alma Mater</li>
</ul>

<h2>During the game</h2>
<ul>
<li>When KU scores, yell "Point K-U!" (Guys yell in megaphones, Girls clap "point" and do K-U with arm motions, then a clap, clap with the band*), then spirit (not on the court) if time allows.</li>
<li>Be ready at any time to help throw t-shirts and assist with the halftime volleyball game.  (Don't expect to eat/rest at halftime, most likely they will want you to deliver prizes or collect balls for the halftime game).</li>
<li>Take a knee (like in football) if there is an injury</li>
<li>Pay attention -- there will be balls coming at you fast!</li>
<li>When we do something good, spirit.</li>
<li>Hit the crowd after doing any skill.</li>
<li>Start chants any time except when the ball is being served.</li>
<li>When the game is in play, if you're not chanting, watch it with your hands behind your back and feet together (guys - feet apart) in your corner, girls closer to the court.
Be happy and excited the entire game. Don't show boredom, frustration, or anger.</li>
<li>Remember to smile!  The crowd is much closer for these games and you are being more closely watched.</li>
<li>At the end of the game, spirit.  Wave the wheat, followed by "I'm a."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeouts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Go out on the court on the side of the net that our team is currently on, and face away from the team benches.</li>
<li>Entertain with fight songs, stunts, and tumbling while the band plays.</li>
</ul>
