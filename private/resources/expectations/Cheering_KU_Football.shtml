<h1>Cheering KU Football</h1>

<h2>The Schedule</h2>

<ul>

<li><b>2 hours before game</b>: Show up at our locker room at the stadium in full uniform/hair/makeup. If you need to get taped show up earlier. Guys: place flags on asphalt behind southwest end zone. Place half the signs and megs in NW and SE corners on track -- never quite against the fence where fans could reach them.</li> 

<li><b>1.5 hours before the game</b>: mingle in couples outside the stadium at your assigned area.</li>

<li><b>45 minutes before game</b>: Warm up on the track in the northwest corner (bowl) of the stadium.</b></li>

<li><b>22 minutes before game:</b> Be at your gate in the north bowl.</li>

<li><b>After the band leaves your gate</b>: Shut the gate then RUN to your pregame spot on the sideline. Do the pregame.</li>

<li><b>When the band leaves the field to I'm a Jayhawk</b>: everyone go to the band's tunnel for the team (flag runners grab flags), except for the "Rock Chalk - Jayhawk" sign people who grab the signs (they'll be placed near the 25-yard-lines). Start the signs on Corey's cue (should be around 6.5 minutes left on the clock). Tunnel people throw baskets during signs and while waiting for the team. After signs, sign people run back to the tunnel and should start Let's Go Jayhawks if possible.</li>

<li><b>When the team runs out</b>: Run the flags, and if you don't have a flag, run to the 50 yard line then do a long tumbling pass. Then run to where your squad is cheering.</li>

<li><b>Do Kickoff</b>, then start cheering. Flags stay in south end and whichever squad is closest to them runs them after a touchdown..</li>

<li><b>At end of first quarter</b>, perform during the quarter break, then huddle to listen to coach, then jog (with equipment) to the next spot.</li>

<li><b>At halftime</b>, go to the locker room.</li>

<li><b>3 minutes before the second half</b>, be back in the stadium to get equipment to your third quarter spot.</b></li>

<li><b>At end of third quarter</b>, perform during quarter break, then huddle to listen to coach, then jog (with equipment) to the next spot.</li>

<li><b>At the end of the game</b>, wave the wheat and do I'm a Jayhawk motions. Then, on your sideline, do Alma Mater and Rock Chalk while the football team does it. After the football team leaves, go to locker room. Don't enter the locker room until after the equipment is in it.</li>

<li>No one leaves until all equipment is put away and the locker room is clean.</li>

</ul>

<h2>General Cheer Strategies</h2>

<h3>Being in Uniform</h3>
<p>Remember that whenever you're in uniform, you're "performing;" people are judging your behavior all the time and you're representing not only yourself, but KU, the athletic department, and 100+ years of KU cheerleading tradition. Take pride in that, and represent well. In particular:

<ul>
	<li>Cheerleaders should be "perfect" fans. We don't taunt the opposition, complain about the ref's calls, or show anger or disappointment when our team screws up. </li>
	<li>Remember body language: keep your weight centered evenly on your feet, don't slouch, and if sitting, don't sprawl out. If you're doing nothing, keep your hands at your side or clasped behind or in front of your back. Don't cross your arms or put your hands on your hips. </li>
	<li>Don't chew gum visibly.</li>
	<li>Don't swear, spit, or do any other gross manly things.</li>
	<li>If a skill drops, don't look upset -- spirit instead.</li>
</ul>


<h3>When we're on Offense</h3> 
<ul>
	<li>Start chants right after a play and end the chant as our team approaches the line. NEVER make noise or entice the crowd to make noise when our offense is lined up.</li>
</ul>

<h3>When we're on Defense</h3>
<ul>
	<li>In general, on defense, chants/noise are started about 10 seconds after the previous play so that they're loudest when the other team is lined up.</li>
	<li>We generally do "Noise" EVERY 1st and 3rd down and non-punting 4th down, and "De-fense" EVERY 2nd down. When you do noise, go crazy - people on the ends should spread out and run down the sideline to hit as much of the crowd possible. Put up the noise signs in stunts, and pop off the stunt by the time the play starts.</li>
</ul>


<h3>During Game Stoppages</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Let the crowd rest while you entertain them with pyramids, baskets, stunts, and tumbling.</li>
	<li>Don't start chants unless instructed to do so. An exception would be to start a chant as the timeout ends.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Anytime</h3>
<ul>
	<li>When we do something good (1st down, big stop, get a turnover), throw a quick-hitting skill (ie, toss stunt, tuck, etc).</li>
	<li>Hit the crowd after doing any skill (including tumbling).</li>
	<li>When the game is in play, watch it with your hands behind your back and feet together (guys - feet apart). </li>
	<li>If you're not leading the crowd, you should be in your space in the line. </li>
	<li>Football games are long -- stay focused and don't screw around.</li>
	<li>Be sharp and clean with all your motions and skills.</li>
	<li>Guys - hit your megaphone to the claps of chants; cup the mouth-end when yelling to be as loud as possible.</li>
	<li>Be happy and excited the entire game. Don't show boredom, frustration, or anger.</li>
</ul>
