<h1>Cheering KU Basketball</h1>

<h2>The Schedule</h2>

<li><b>1 hour before game</b>: Be in the locker room taped and ready. We usually warm up in Horejsi. </li>

<li><b>30 minutes before game</b>: Mingle in the stands and concourses with partner (not in bigger groups) to say hello to the fans. <strong>A Guy or two</strong> places small Jayhawk flag in the correct tunnel and split the megs and signs on each baseline: 
7 megs (5 for women's), Rock Chalk Square, 4 Noise/Noise, 4 Defense/Defense, 4 Let's Go Jayhawks, 4 Rock Chalk Jayhawk.<br />
</li>

<li><b>15 minutes before game</b>: Be on the court (on baseline) with megs and signs. <em><strong>Clap along to the music and throw a few safe stunts.</strong></em> (At this time, lots of people will be watching you, so treat it like an unscripted performance. Don't chat or just stand there). Don't stunt if players are right behind you.</li>

<li><b>12 minutes before game</b>: For men's games, line up along the free throw lines and face the crowd behind the basket. For women's games, make one line facing the non-bench side (the dancers will be in a line behind you facing the benches). Then we do:
<ul>
<li>alma mater</li>
<li>rock chalk chant</li>
<li>Men's games: Then band plays Jazzy I'm a Jayhawk, which you clap to and put the Rock Chalk Square signs up <em>before the song ends</em> ("Rock" sign faces non-band basket)</li>
<li>Women's games: Do Rock Chalk - Jay-Hawk signs pointing toward the sides.</li>
<li>After signs, go back to the baselines, except the flag guy goes to the tunnel. </li>
</ul>

<li><b>Approx 4 minutes before game</b>: Team returns to floor led by flag. Do I'm a Jayhawk motions on the baseline.</li>

<li><b>0 minutes before game</b>: Do National Anthem on the baseline. After national anthem, run on the court to make a wide  tunnel while the video stats. After the video, do player intros, which are:
    <ul>
        <li>Player 1: toss hands</li>
        <li>Player 2: extend</li>
        <li>Player 3: pop off and spirit</li>
        <li>Player 4: toss hands</li>
        <li>Player 5: extend, then turn to your right toward the crowd, then popoff</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li><b>After player intros</b>: return to baselines.</li>

<h2>During the Game</h2>

<h3>Formation and Meg Direction</h3>
<p>During the game, we cheer with one couple in each tunnel for men's games (usually no one in tunnel for women's games).  5 dancers will be sitting in the middle, with a cheer girl outside them, and a cheer guy outside them. On the 3-couple side, the sitting guy will be on the outside. This formation gives us good sound coverage and allows us to angle our megs upward a bit. (Note that important people sit at the tables, so we can't block their view, at least not for very long at all.) Guys make sure you totally cup the meg. At the beginning of a chant, the guy who's aiming cross-court should first point his meg toward the cheerleaders on the other side so they can hear it and pick it up. Once they do, the guy should aim his meg about 45 degrees toward his part of the crowd. Tunnel megs point back to students behind the baskets.  </p>

<h3>Sitting at the Table</h3>
<p>First rule is don't lean back against the table because it'll break the sign. Second, always appear interested in the game and never look bored. Don't yawn, slouch, sprawl out, chat, mess with your hair or nails, etc. In addition to leading the crowd, cheerleaders should also be 'perfect' fans when sitting on the floor, which means we clap whenever our team does something good, which is much more than just making a basket, such as: gettting a rebound, making a steal, getting fouled, or blocking a shot. Also, never yell about bad calls or talk to the opposing players or refs. Refs can hear you and have given technical fouls due to cheerleaders' behavior.</p>

<h3>Cheering in the Tunnels (men's games only)</h3>
<p>Stand in the tunnel (thus you're not blocking any fan's view) with your partner. Tunnel guys: point meg to student section. Girls: use signs, put signs up in chairs occasionally.</p>


<h3>Chants</h3>
<p>Remember that anyone can start a chant. Start your chants IMMEDIATELY after a change of possession, such as right after the opponent makes a basket or right after we get a steal or a rebound. Whenever something really deflating happens like our opponents get a dunk or a 3, start "Let's Go Jayhawks" because that's the chant the crowd is most likely to join in on. Whenever we make a dunk or a three, we should usually do noise because the crowd's in the yelling mood. Just like in football, noise on defense is the most effective thing. If you're ever sitting there and think, "boy, it's quiet in here," start a chant. Even if it's just a "filler" chant that the crowd probably won't do, the sound breaks up the boring silence. </p>

<h3>When We Make a Basket</h3>
<p>After we make a basket (other than a free throw), girls stand up and spirit to the crowd. However, limit yourself to three 'hops' then sit back down quickly to not block peoples' view.</p>

<h3>Free Throws</h3>
<p>If one of our players is shooting the first free throw of a two-shot foul on the side opposite of you, 3 girls stand at the baseline facing the crowd, put your hands in the air and wiggle dem fingers, then if the crowd says "Whooosh," you do a back tuck. In general, guys won't do the tucks unless they're filling in for a girl who can't do it. These are on TV a LOT, so make sure you're smiling and don't bite it. If a guy(s) has to do it, arrange guys and girls symmetrically. Don't use the girl in the far tunnel for the tuck unless you have to.</p>

<h3>Substitutions</h3>
<p>For EVERY KU substitution, girls should stand up and clap for the player who's leaving the game. Guys should clap too but can remain seated if you'd like (if you want to stretch the legs, this is your chance).</p>

<h3>Timeouts</h3>
<p>We only go out on the court for some of the media timeouts that occur at the first stoppage of play when the clock is under the 16, 12, 8, and 4-minute marks. For other coach-called timeouts (which are 30 or 60 seconds), we stand up and do our thing on the baseline. We might also do signs occasionally during timeouts.</p>

<h2>Halftime</h2>
<p>At halftime, grab a drink or watch the halftime show, but go to the locker room immediately after to meet with coach (sometimes for women's games we just meet in the tunnel). Flag guy must be at flag with 5 minutes left in halftime; everyone else be on the floor at 2 minutes left. </p>

<h2>After the Game</h2>
<p>After the game, wave the wheat on the court at hands if it's safe to go to hands. Then do I'm a Jayhawk. Afterward, <em><strong>guys go with coach to put the flag, megs, and signs back in the 3rd floor storage closet.</strong></em></p>
