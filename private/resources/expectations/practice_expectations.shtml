<h1>Practice Expectations</h1>

<h3>Attitude</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Stay positive - encourage others and yourself.</li>
	<li>When you get frustrated, focus your energy on how you can improve the situation.</li>
	<li>If you have an inappropriate outburst of frustration or anger, you get to run three laps to think about how your outbursts help or hurt yourself and the squad.</li>
	<li>Handle problems with each other directly and professionally. Don't talk behind people's backs.</li>
	<li>"Own" the skill or routine you're working on - if it falls, don't blame others - concentrate on what you can do to make it better.</li>
	<li>If your attitude is hurting the squad, you'll be kicked out of practice. You can come back when your attitude is improved.</li>
	<li>Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you respond to it - respond wisely - be an "improver," not a coper or quitter.</li>
	<li>Be confident - expect success, expect to win, expect adversity and overcome it.</li>
	<li>Swearing gets you 25 (your choice of push-ups or crunches).</li>
	<li>No excuses!</li>
</ol>


<h3>Efficiency</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Be taped, stretching, and listening to the coaches the minute practice is scheduled to begin.</li>
	<li>When a coach yells "Come In," run in immediately and do not talk.</li>
	<li>Listen when a coach or captain is speaking to the squad.</li>
	<li>If a coach is around when a skill comes down, don't talk until the coach has spoken.</li>
	<li>Have a sense of urgency when stunting and tumbling; rest as little as possible between attempts; quickly throw about five in a row then rest.</li>
	<li>If you need to have an in-depth talk with a coach, do it either after practice, well before practice, or by email.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Safety</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Spot aggressively and catch as high as possible.</li>
	<li>No jewelry or hats.</li>
	<li>No unnecessary talking when pyramids or stunts are up.</li>
	<li>If you're injured, see the trainers and follow their instructions precisely.</li>
	<li>Everyone does 25 if a girl hits the floor.</li>
</ol>
