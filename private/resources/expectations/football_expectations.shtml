<h1>Expectations at Football Games</h1>

<h3>When we're on Offense</h3> 
<ul>
	<li>Start chants right after a play and end the chant as our team approaches the line.</li>
</ul>

<h3>When we're on Defense</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Start chants/noise about 10 seconds after the previous play.</li>
	<li>Do "Noise" EVERY 3rd down and non-punting 4th down (only exception being if the game is a blowout). When you do noise, go crazy - people on the ends should spread out and run down the sideline (but not behind the team) to hit as much of the crowd possible. Put up the noise signs too.</li>
</ul>


<h3>During Game Stoppages</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Let the crowd rest while you entertain them with pyramids, baskets, stunts, and tumbling.</li>
	<li>Don't start chants. An exception would be to start a chant as the timeout ends.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Anytime</h3>
<ul>
	<li>When we do something good, throw a skill.</li>
	<li>Hit the crowd after doing any skill </li>
	<li>When the game is in play, watch it with your hands behind your back and feet together (guys - feet apart). </li>
	<li>If you're not leading the crowd, you should be in your space in the line. </li>
	<li>Be sharp and clean with all your motions and skills.</li>
	<li>Guys - beat your megaphone to the claps of chants; cup the mouth-end when yelling to be as loud as possible.</li>
	<li>Don't chew gum visibly.</li>
	<li>Be happy and excited the entire game. Don't show boredom, frustration, or anger. For example, don't get pissed off after dropping a stunt or after the ref makes a horrible call.</li>
</ul>
