<h1>Corey's Book List</h1>
<p>Listed below are a bunch of books I've listened to when I had a really long commute to work and a big corporate library to choose from! So why did I put them on our cheer site? Some of them have given me ideas on how to run the squad, so you can give them a read (or listen) if you're interested. Also, although most of these books are considered "business" books, they cover some really important principles and ideas that will serve you well throughout your life. Remember that the people who get ahead are the people who never stop learning. </p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0066620996/" target="_blank">Good to Great</a>, Jim Collins<br />
Excellent book on how great organizations differ from good or average organizations.
Transformation = Buildup followed by breakthrough. Three stages:
<ol>
<li>Disciplined People:
	<ul>
	<li>Level 5 Leadership (humble w/ will to do whatever it takes)
	<li>First Who, then What (get the right people on the bus, wrong people off it, and people in the right seats)
	</ul>
<li>Disciplined Thought:
	<ul>
	<li>Confront Brutal Facts without losing faith in ability to prevail (Stockdale)
	<li>Hedgehog concept: deep understanding of three intersecting circles: 
		<ul>
		<li>What you can be the best at
		<li>What drives your economic engine
		<li>What you are deeply passionate about
		</ul>
	</ul>
<li>Disciplined Action (culture of discipline)
	<ul>
	<li>Begin "stop-doing" list (things that take you away from your hedgehog concept)
	<li>Stay focused on three circles of your hedgehog concept
	<li>Technology accelerators
	</ul>
</ol>

Accumulate momentum to turn the "big flywheel." Once you have momentum, preserve core ideologies while stimulating change and progress. Set "Big Hairy Audacious Goals" that fall in your three circles.<br /><br />

<ul>
<li>The best managers select an employee for their innate talents (such as striving, strategizing, or relating) rather than for skills or experience (which can be learned).
<li>Set expectations by defining the right outcomes rather than the right steps.
<li>Motivate by building on each person's unique strengths rather than trying to fix his weaknesses.
<li>Develop people by finding the right fit for each person, not the next rung on the ladder.
</ul>
If employees can answer the below questions affirmatively, you probably have a strong and productive workplace:
<ol>
	<li>Do I know what is expected of me at work?</li>
	<li>Do I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right?</li>
	<li>At work, do I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day?</li>
	<li>In the last seven days, have I received recognition or praise for good work?</li>
	<li>Does my supervisor, or someone at work, seem to care about me as a person?</li>
	<li>Is there someone at work who encourages my development?</li>
	<li>At work, do my opinions seem to count?</li>
	<li>Does the mission/purpose of my company make me feel like my work is important?</li>
	<li>Are my co-workers committed to doing quality work?</li>
	<li>Do I have a best friend at work?</li>
	<li>In the last six months, have I talked with someone about my progress?</li>
	<li>At work, have I had the opportunities to learn and grow?</li>
</ol>

"People don't change that much. Don't waste time trying to put in what was left out. Try to draw out what was left in. That is hard enough."<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316172324/" target="_blank">Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking</a>, by Malcolm Gladwell<br />
Gladwell's one of those authors who can write about anything and make it really interesting. A review: "How do we make decisions--good and bad--and why are some people so much better at it than others? Thats the question Malcolm Gladwell asks and answers in the follow-up to his huge bestseller, The Tipping Point. Utilizing case studies as diverse as speed dating, pop music, and the shooting of Amadou Diallo, Gladwell reveals that what we think of as decisions made in the blink of an eye are much more complicated than assumed. Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience and psychology, he shows how the difference between good decision-making and bad has nothing to do with how much information we can process quickly, but on the few particular details on which we focus."<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553378589/" target="_blank">Working with Emotional Intelligence</a>, by Daniel Goleman<br />
"Analyses done by dozens of experts in 500 corporations, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations worldwide conclude that emotional intelligence is the barometer of excellence on virtually any job." I listened to the abridged audio book, which was still four CD's. I've heard the real book is pretty wordy, but it's really important stuff that everyone should know. I recommend everyone listen to this one, or check out the shorter book below.<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Emotional-Intelligence-Quick-Book/dp/0743273265/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1226611310&sr=8-1">The Emotional Intelligence Quick Book</a>, by Travis Bradbury and Jean Greaves.<br />
I haven't read this, but it looks like it might be a good shorter alternative to the Working with Emotional Intelligence book.<br /><br /> 

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0786866020/" target="_blank">Fish! A Remarkable Way to Boost Morale and Improve Results</a>, by  Stephen C. Lundin, Harry Paul, John Christensen. <br />
Good read on team morale. The main points are:
<ul>
	<li>Choose Your Attitude - Each day you choose how you are going to act or which "side of the bed" you wake up on. The choice is yours and the way you act affects others.</li>
	<li>Play - Have fun and create energy.</li>
	<li>Make Their Day - How can you engage fellow employees, customers and make each other's day?</li>
	<li>Be Present - How can you make sure you are fully available and aware during conversations with people? </li>

I haven't read this one, but Heidi recommended it and it sounded pretty good. Here's a review: "The four agreements are these: Be impeccable with your word. Don't take anything personally. Don't make assumptions. Always do your best. It's the how and why one should do these things that make The Four Agreements worth reading and remembering."<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071447741/" target="_blank">Great Motivation Secrets of Great Leaders</a>, by John Baldoni.<br />
Good book with lots of stories on how the best leaders motivate others:
<ul>
<li>Exemplify Integrity: do what you say you'll do; live your values</li>
<li>Communicate Relentlessly: speak, listen, and learn as a leader</li>
<li>Challenge with Creativity</li>
<li>Empower with Vigor: delegate responsibility and authority, hold people accountable</li>
<li>Coach Frequently: listen, praise, then critique; follow through and follow up</li>
<li>Recognize Meaningfully</li>
<li>Sacrifice with Honor: put the team's needs first; share the pain; make sacrifices count</li>
<li>Inspire by Example: volunteer first, lead from the front</li>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0688123163/" target="_blank">Raving Fans - A Revolutionary Approach to Customer Service</a>, by Ken Blanchard and Sheldon Bowles.<br />
"Your customers are only satisfied because their expectations are so low and because no one else is doing better. Just having satisfied customers isn't good enough anymore. If you really want a booming business, you have to create Raving Fans by:
<ol>
	<li>Decide on a vision-a level of service that perfectly reflects what you want to give customers.</li>
	<li>Discover the specific needs and expectations of your customers and weave them into your vision of how to serve them.</li>
	<li>Deliver your vision a step at a time, being absolutely consistent before stepping up the service to the next level."</li>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0071351450/" target="_blank">Bringing Out the Best in People</a>, Aubrey C. Daniels<br />
Mostly about positive reinforcement and creating systems that include positive reinforcement; considers the downside of goals (ie, that people stop when they reach the goal); more scientific than the others. Interesting stuff, starts kinda slowly.<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060516402/" target="_blank">Built to Last - Successful Habits of Visionary Companies</a>, by Jim Collins and Jerry Porras.<br />
Pretty good, though not as good as "Good to Great" (by the same author). And even though this book was written before Good to Great, read Good to Great first if you read both. The main points:
<ul>
	<li>If you want to last, your culture must be values-based. </li>
	<li>You must clearly understand your "core purpose" as well as embrace, articulate, hire to, and demonstrate your core values. </li>
	<li>Your vision must include a BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal) to lend continued vitality to your organizations. </li>
</ul>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316346624/" target="_blank">The Tipping Point - How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference</a>, by Malcolm Gladwell<br />
Interesting stuff: "Ideas, behavior, messages, and products, he argues, often spread like outbreaks of infectious disease. Just as a single sick person can start an epidemic of the flu, so too can a few fare-beaters and graffiti artists fuel a subway crime wave, or a satisfied customer fill the empty tables of a new restaurant. These are social epidemics, and the moment when they take off, when they reach their critical mass, is the Tipping Point. ...Gladwell introduces us to the particular personality types who are natural pollinators of new ideas and trends, the people who create the phenomenon of word of mouth."<br /><br /> 

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743201140/" target="_blank">Now, Discover Your Strengths</a>, by Marcus Buckingham and Donald Clifton<br />
This is some really interesting stuff. Basically, he says each of us has strengths (things we can do  very well and consistently) which are made up of our talents (consistent behavior patterns), skills, and knowledge. Skills and knowledge can be learned, but talents cannot. Therefore, we should identify our talents, build upon them, and milk them for all their worth. This will yield much better results than if we took the traditional approach of trying to "improve our weaknesses," which will only yield small improvements. There's an online test at strengthsfinder.com that will identify your strongest "themes" (similar to "strengths"), but the kicker is each book or CD allows only one test to be taken, so you have to buy the book or CD new to take the test.<br />

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0785274308/" target="_blank">Failing Forward - Turning Mistakes into Stepping Stones for Success</a>, by John C. Maxwell<br />
Pretty good book whose main idea is that the main difference between average people and "achievers" is that achievers accept failure, learn from it, and never give up.
<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0070653380/" target="_blank">The Articulate Executive: Learn to Look, Act, and Sound Like a Leader</a>, by Granville N. Toogood<br />
Good book on public speaking and giving presentation. His "Power" formula for designing a speech is:<br />
P. Power - Start Strong.<br />
O. One Theme.<br />
W. Windows to illustrate your theme.<br />
E. Ear - Your presentation should be conversational.<br />
R. Retention - End your presentation with a call to action.
<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1565114248/" target="_blank">The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement</a>, by Eliyahu M. Goldratt<br />
"In its simplest form, The Goal is about making effective and informed decisions. The author takes his readers on a very thorough, step-by-step discovery of the many fallacies and misconceptions invading much of the way today's society views and measures the production process. Gradratt conveys his message in novel form by relaying the struggles of a man, Alex Rogo, who is trying to figure out a way to not only save his career but also save his marriage."<br />
The book is long (9 CDs) but interesting. In the end, they genericize the problem-solving process to first determine the one overall goal, then answer these questions: 1) What needs to be changed to accomplish the goal? 2) What does it need to be changed to? 3) What's the best way to cause the change?

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0976268604/" target="_blank">Joy at Work: A Revolutionary Approach to Fun on the Job</a>, Dennis Bakke<br />
This concept of this book is excellent - I just wish I'd been able to listen to an abridged version. A recap: 'Mr. Bakke defines joy using a sports analogy. It's like having the chance to make the winning shot at the buzzer in a basketball game. You're in charge, regardless of what your job is in the organization. If you speak with any management person, they will probably tell you that they hope to work as a CEO someday. Why? I think the motivation mostly relates to wanting to be able to call the shots about something and see how it all turns out. In our authoritarian organizations (which includes almost all of them), very few people have the say on any given decision. It's like being a child all of your life . . . while Dad and Mom decide for you. Bakke argues for the opposite. Put everyone in charge and have the "higher ups" function as support for those on the line.'<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060937386/" target="_blank">Control Your Destiny or Someone Else Will</a>, Noel Tichy and Stratford Sherman<br />
A book about Jack Welch (considered one of the best managers/CEOs ever) and how he turned around GE in the 80's and 90's. Has some pretty good stuff, but too much glorifying of Welch and GE.<br />
"The old way, exemplified by Henry Ford's production line, calls for top managers to analyze the work that needs to be done, then devise rules even an idiot can follow. Managers, divorced from the actual work, become bureaucrats, while their frustrated subordinates tighten the bolts...The new way-GE's way-breaks the intellectual framework that defines the limits of traditional management...Instead of seeking better ways to control workers, Welch says he aims to liberate them. As he explains, that goal is based on self-interest: The old organization was built on control, but the world has changed. The world is moving at such a pace that control has become a limitation. It slows you down. You've got to balance freedom with some control, but you've got to have more freedom than you ever dreamed of" (pp.19-20).<br />
Welch's ideas of empowering the employee encompassed such things as "boundarylessness", strong values, leadership, simplicity, and productivity. <br /><br />

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0142000280/" target="_blank">Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity</a>, David Allen<br />
Dang this one's a snoozer, but some good info:<br />
The author starts with: "It's possible for a person to have an overwhelming number of things to do and still function productively with a clear head and a positive sense of relaxed control."<br />
He says the keys to doing so are to:
<ol>
	<li>Write down your "to-do's" in a place that you always have access to and will remember to look at. This clears your head from trying to remember a bunch of stuff.</li>
	<li>When you write down to-do's, don't write them as a 'project' - such as "Create marketing brochure." Instead, write down the 'next action(s)' you need to take on the project, such as "Select photos to include in brochure." This makes it much more manageable and easier to make steady progress on larger projects.</li>
	<li>When going through your to-do list (or "Inbox"), if something will take less than two minutes to do, just do it now. </li>
	<li>Review your to-do list once a week to decide if some things should be reprioritized or moved to a "someday/maybe" list.</li>
</ol>
He also advocates having a good filing system.<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0785274340/" target="_blank">The 17 Indisputable Laws of Teamwork</a>, John C. Maxwell<br />
Pretty good. Lots of sports examples.<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0785266666/" target="_blank">Developing the Leader Within You</a>, John C. Maxwell<br />
Still pretty good because it's John Maxwell, but similar material to the 21 Irrefutable Laws book.<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0785274324/" target="_blank">The 21 Most Powerful Minutes in a Leader's Day</a>, John C. Maxwell<br />
Maxwell presents the 21 Leadership Laws again but this time uses biblical examples of each.<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0785261508/" target="_blank">Developing the Leaders Around You</a>, John C. Maxwell<br />
Here's someone's review on Amazon: "The basic premise of this book is that you can multiply the efficiency of your organization by devoting time to developing the potential leaders around you. The idea is that once you commit to developing potential leaders, they in turn become leaders who can develop other leaders, and as the number of leaders grows, productivity increases. The book provides guidelines as to how to identify those individuals who have the potential for leadership, and then gives instruction on how to develop them. The guidelines and instruction Maxwell gives can be summarized as follows: choose the individuals who are the most willing to grow and learn new things as your potential leaders, and grow them by investing time in them, empowering them for success by delegating wisely and providing counsel."<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385260954/" target="_blank">The Fifth Discipline</a>, Peter Senge<br />
Review from Amazon: "Senge proposes the "systems thinking" method to help a corporation to become a "learning organization," one that integrates at all personnel levels indifferently related company functions (sales, product design, etc.) to "expand the ability to produce." He describes requisite disciplines, of which systems-thinking is the fifth. Others include "personal mastery" of one's capacities and "team learning" through group discussion of individual objectives and problems. Employees and managers are also encouraged to examine together their often negative perceptions or "mental models" of company people and procedures."<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/074323538X/" target="_blank">Whale Done! The Power of Positive Relationships</a>, by Ken Blanchard<br />
"In Whale Done!, Ken Blanchard shows how to make accentuating the positive and redirecting the negative the best tools to increase productivity, instead of creating situations that demoralize people...He explains the difference between "GOTcha" (catching people doing things wrong) and "Whale Done!" (catching people doing things right).

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0609610570/" target="_blank">Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done</a>, by Larry Bossidy & Ram Charan<br />
Long and aimed at fairly high-level executives. "...the ultimate difference between a company and its competitor is, in fact, the ability to execute. Execution is "the missing link between aspirations and results," and as such, making it happen is the business leader's most important job."
<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0071398503/" target="_blank">Brand Warfare - 10 Rules for Building the Killer Brand</a>, by David D'Alessandro<br />
Fairly good book about building and maintaining a company's brand name.
<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0071396837/" target="_blank">The Southwest Airlines Way : Using the Power of Relationships to Achieve High Performance</a>, by Jody Gittell<br />
Stresses how important relationships are to the success of an organization. Discusses Southwest's values of "Shared Goals, Shared Knowledge, and Mutual Respect." Some good stuff, but the book seemed redundant and longer than it needed to be. A good quote: "You find an individual with an upbeat and positive attitude -- and you'll find that everything that needs to be done, will get done. It's very contagious."

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446678295/" target="_blank">Extreme Management - What they teach at Harvard Business School's Advanced Management Program</a>, Mark Stevens<br />
Pretty dry; kinda textbook-like. Had some good info, but often too high-level to be useful.<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684846659/" target="_blank">The Eighth Habit</a>, Stephen Covey<br />
Covey calls for an eighth habit to achieve personal and organizational excellence: "Find your voice [what you're passionate about] and inspire others to find theirs." Also to do work/activities you're passionate about.<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060521996/" target="_blank">The Innovator's Dilemma</a>, Clayton Christiansen<br />
Had some good points on why big companies fail to successfully implement disruptive technologies in small emerging markets. Overall, boring and repetitive.<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446385328/" target="_blank">How to Sell Anything to Anybody</a>, Joe Girard<br />
Not a great book, but at least it was short. I thought his most important point was his "rule of 250," which basically states that every person knows approximately 250 people, so your reputation (good or bad) spreads very quickly. Thus, you want everyone you meet to consider you honest, trustworthy, etc. <br /><br />
