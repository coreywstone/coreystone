        <h1>16-hour Redesign of <span style="white-space: nowrap">"Job Hound"</span> SaaS</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <p class="bigintro" style="text-align: left;">Job Hound is a free online tool I've used to track the status of job applications. It's a handy tool, but its UI was lacking, so I volunteered to do a quick free redesign of it for the lone developer who generously built it.</p>
        </div>

            <img src="/img/jobhound/jobhound-home.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" style="margin-bottom: 30px;" alt="Mockup of Job Hound home page on desktop and mobile." />

            <h2 class="partialwidth"><i class="fa fa-bomb"></i><br />Problem</h2>
            <p>Job Hound's existing UI (shown below) was <strong>not click-efficient or forthcoming</strong> with its information, and it had almost no branding or visual appeal.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">        
            <h2 class="partialwidth"><i class="fa fa-bullseye"></i><br />Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Bring the core functionality to the home page to reduce interaction cost.</li>
                <li>Make it pretty. <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i> Seriously though, it's a nice tool that might generate ad or sponsor revenue, and professional/credible-looking visual design would help.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">        
            <h2 class="partialwidth"><i class="fa fa-dropbox"></i><br />Constraints</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Time was my biggest constraint, trying to slip it in amongst my full-time work and family time.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
    </div>

        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <h2><i class="fa fa-child"><br /></i> My Role</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Information architecture</strong> redesign.</li>
                <li><strong>UX, UI, and Visual Design</strong> created in <strong>Sketch</strong>.</li>
                <li>Exported to <strong>Zeplin</strong> so the developer could grab the CSS and image assets.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <h2><i class="fa fa-group"></i> The Team</h2>
            <p>It was just me and the JobHound.io founder/developer, Scott Johnson, who says he'll implement the redesign if and when he can find the time.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <h2><i class="fa fa-retweet"></i> Process</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="row example">
        <div class="col-md-9">
            <p><strong>This was a "not good process" project.</strong> Basically, I:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>started with the UX problems I'd observed from using the tool (ie, user = self).</li>
                <li>internalized the user goals based on my needs and my untested assumptions and common sense about how others would probably use the tool.</li>
                <li>applied my design and usability experience to flesh out my ideas in mockups, iterating to improve the design based on my perception of the weaknesses of my proposed design.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why include a "bad process" project in my portfolio?</strong> Beause I've found that in the real world, there's occasionally a need to crank out a good-enough design very quickly due to time and/or budget constraints, and this shows what I can do under similar circumstances.</p>
        </div> 
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <h2><i class="fa fa-flag"></i> Results</h2>
    </div>
     <div class="row example">
        <div class="col-md-3">
        <p>I theorized users wanted <strong>quick random access</strong> to elements in the site, so I used <strong>persistent mega-menus</strong> as global navigation for the easily updateable site.</p>
        
        <p>Each element had:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Usage</strong> guidance</li>
            <li><strong>Accessibility</strong> guidance in blue callouts.</li>
            <li><strong>CSS specs</strong> in orange</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Previously, UX, Brand, &amp; Editorial guidelines were in separate documents. We combined them into this single style guide to make it easier for staff and vendors to find any style-related data.</p>

     <div class="row example">
        <div class="col-md-3">
        <p>I also created an <strong>ACT Widget Library</strong> in Axure RP so the other designers and I could quickly make style-compliant mockups.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <h2><i class="fa fa-book"></i> Learnin'</h2>
       </div>     
            
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">        
                <p>Through this project, I learned:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>how to make Team widget libraries in Axure.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>InVision's Design System Manager (DSM)</strong>, though it ended up not being flexible enough for what we wanted to do.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Creating our style guide in Axure made a lot of sense because it's our UI prototyping tool, but Axure sites aren't searchable, and our Brand team needed an Axure license to update the site, neither or which were ideal. So the solution wasn't perfect, but I'm not sure there was a better solution out there for our needs.</p>
                
                <p>This project was also a nice opportunity for the UX team to collaborate with our Brand team, which hadn't been happening much.</p>
