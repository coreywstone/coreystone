            <p>This was a big, long, ongoing project that didn't start well. They didn't have a user/design-centric process or culture, and when developers needed UX guidance, they went to the BA who had been designing mockups. It <strong>reinforced my belief in the importance of strong relationships between designers and developers</strong>. It took awhile, but eventually the whole team happily came to me for any UI problems or changes needed to my mockups.</p>
            
            <p>Working in ACT's SAFe Agile process across multiple teams definitely <strong>improved my skills in Agile, Jira, and product management</strong> (which I did for a few months).</p>
            
            <p>My <strong>Axure RP prototyping skills improved</strong> as I learned how to use its variables and adaptive (responsive) views. Axure doesn't get much pub, but it's a pretty good tool!</p>
            
            <p>Finally, the tight launch deadlines and 'UX backlog' mentality taught me to know when to be patient with UI changes (or lack thereof) and when to push for the most important UX improvements, all while trying to educate the company on how to move user-centric design earlier in the process to improve coding and implementation efficiency, removing the need for so much rework. As John Wooden says, <strong>"If you don't have time to do it right, when will you have time to do it over?"</strong></p>
