                <li>Billing delays were costing the company millions.</li>
                <li>Staff were wasting time and billable hours struggling to find project and contract files.</li>
                <li>Health &amp; Safety incident reports were too slow with low completion rates, which increased financial and safety risk.</li>

    <div class="row example">
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>To fully understand the processes and problems, I first traveled to multiple offices to <strong>interview staffers in various roles</strong>. After assimilating the results and digging deeper as needed, I learned:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The billing system was sending so many email notifications that most people ignored (and auto-routed) all of them.</li>
                <li>It was hard for staff to know which project or bill was delayed and why.</li>
                <li>The safety-tracking application was unintuitive, inefficient, and didn't alert people to what needed to be done, so issues got lost in the process.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>I then proposed some quick fixes and started designing longer-term solutions, getting <strong>continuous online feedback</strong> from staff as I <strong>iterated and tested in clickable Axure RP prototypes</strong>.

        <h2><i class="fa fa-flag"></i> Results</h2>
        <p class="col-md-8">The quick fixes of <strong>sending only relevant email notifications</strong> and some minor process changes in the legacy system <strong>successfully saved money</strong> by decreasing some of the billing delays. Woot! Other solutions included:</p>

        <h3>Cost-Saving Enterprise Operations Dashboard</h3>
        <div class="col-md-3">
           <p>To prevent the costly delays, I designed and user-tested this dashboard concept (mocked up in <strong class="highlight">medium-fidelity</strong>) so <strong>staff could see and fix issues quicker and easier</strong> by displaying:</p>
          <ol>
              <li>Delayed projects first</li>
              <li>Clickable actionable status icons</li>
              <li>Gamified stats to encourage productive behavior</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Staff said the dashboard would really <strong>make their jobs easier</strong> and <strong>increase overall company efficiency.</strong></p>

        <h3>Time-Saving Internal Project Hub</h3>
        <div class="col-md-3">
            <p>To help staff <strong>quickly find project and contract files</strong> across many servers and offices, I worked closely with our small dev team to create a silo-hiding "Project Hub" that gave staff a single search box to find any file or project.</p>
            <p>The project-grouped results included all related project info, files, contact info, and any other data we could get live or from nightly pulls, with links to data sources that we couldn't import.</p>
            <p>The result: <strong>Staff loved it</strong> and said it's been a <strong>huge time-saver.</strong></p>

          <h3>Redesigning the internal "LPS" Health &amp; Safety-Tracking SaaS<a name="lps">&nbsp;</a></h3>
            <div class="col-md-3">
                <p>We totally rebuilt and redesigned the legacy LPS system into a modern, intuitive, efficient SaaS that made the multi-week process <strong>easier and faster</strong> for staff, and <strong>increased completion rates.</strong></p>
                <p>"My To-do's" listed overdue or near-due items at the top in red, while the Item Tracker tab (shown here) let you easily see and act on the status of all your items.</p>

      <div class="row example">
            <div class="col-md-3">
                <p>Because the multi-week process wasn't done by staff very often, the <strong>system guided them</strong> through it with wizard and process bars. Since staff get interrupted often, they could  save their changes any time and return to the same spot easily.</p>
