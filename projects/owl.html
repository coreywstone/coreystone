            <p class="bigintro" style="text-align: left">Owl's SaaS allows mental health clinicians to easily schedule and deliver "measures" (ie, short research-backed assessment tests) to patients so the clinician can monitor their patients' progress. As the sole UX Designer on a small product team, I designed new features, analytics dashboards, and high-fi interactive mockups of future concepts that <strong>helped secure $15M in Series B funding.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Therapists are busy and overbooked</strong>, so their software needs to be very efficient (to save time) and intuitive (to minimize training). Their lack of time also makes it a challenge to do any usability testing with them!</p>

           <p>My <strong>info-packed digestible chart redesign</strong> allowed clinicians to quickly see the patient’s current status and progress over their treatment history.</p>
           <p><strong>One problem:</strong> Test results vary by assessment – on some, “up” is good; on others, "down" is good. <strong>Solution:</strong> I added a 'linear' view with color-coded smile/frown icons for patient severity. To draw the eye to the current status, I put it in larger stronger colors. For clinician speed and efficiency, I used tablet-friendly single-click UI elements.</p>

           <p>By default, patients are sorted by severity to focus the user's attention where it's most needed, and it can be quickly filtered by other criteria for specific use cases.</p>

          <p>At Owl, the VP liked seeing <strong>lots of design options</strong>, so I'd generate them (eg, A-M) then we'd iterate (eg, 1-10) until reaching a final design, which I built into an advanced prototype for usability testing, stakeholder feedback, dev handoff, and sales demos. Here's a screenshot of design exploration for how staff see and manage patients' account invitation status. </p>

          <p>Designing our <strong>industry-leading analytics </strong> was challenging because most of our customers never had access to the level of data we could provide, so they couldn't really tell us what they wanted. We had to rely on our own hypotheses plus input from a few of our more data-savvy researchers and advisors. Here's some of the early concept exploration, with the goals and personas pasted at bottom so I could easily reference while designing.</p>

                <li>Owl was the <strong>first startup I worked at</strong>, and now that I've worked at another and founded my own, it's interesting to see how different their culture and workflow can be from each other.</li>
                <li>I improved my <strong>advanced prototyping</strong> even more, building a very realistic Axure RP prototype that used dynamic date displays (ie, the dates shown in the mockup were based off the current date) and global variables to pass information between pages for a seamless demo experience.</li>
                <li>In my typical process, I usually self-edit much of my iteration, thus not presenting my self-rejected ideas. At Owl, I learned to preserve all my iterations so others could <strong>collaborate on the iteration</strong>.</li>
                <li>As the sole designer, I <strong>wore multiple hats</strong>, including designing marketing material and occasional work on the public-facing website.</li>
