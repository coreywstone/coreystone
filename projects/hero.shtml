        <p class="bigintro">HERO is an iOS app that I conceived, designed, <a href="http://herokeyboard.com" target="_blank">marketed <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>, and managed contract developers to build. In English, just 9 letters are used 80% of the time, so my patented design makes them bigger and centered where your thumb likes to be. The result? <strong>Finger travel is reduced by 35%, or "3 feet per tweet."</strong></p>

           <p class="projectcaption">My concept from 2001 (pre-smartphone) for an embedded in-truck messaging system.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-6 col-sm-6">
              <p>It was <strong>2001</strong> (remember pre-smartphone life? Bring your map!), and I was designing a <strong>small touchscreen keypad for an in-vehicle messaging</strong> system. I'd recently finished my Biomechanics/Ergonomics master's thesis measuring muscle activity on physical keyboards, and after double-checking the anthropometric charts for touch size standards, I realized the <strong>screen was too small to make all keys the recommended size.</strong></p>
            </div>
        </div>

          </div>
          <div class="col-6 col-sm-6">
              <p>Then I thought, <strong>"Why should all the keys be the same size, when we use E waaaay more often than Z, for example?"</strong> So I looked up letter frequencies and found that in English, we use just 9 keys about 80% of the time. Since different-sized keys can't be arranged into a grid very well, I figured I might as well put the most-used keys together, and put the most common letter combinations ("bigrams," like TH and ER) next to each other.</p>
              <p>I was pretty proud of my solution, but when I presented it to the engineering manager, he was like "WTF?" and implemented a simple QWERTY grid. Sigh. But the seed was planted.</p>

              <p><strong>Several years and four kids later</strong>, I found myself doing a lot of one-thumb baby-holding typing and thought "there must be a better way" (to type, not parent). The old QWERTY layout might work well enough for 10-finger typing (and we've built up a lot of muscle memory for it), but it just doesn't make sense for the less-ingrained one or two-finger mobile typing.</p>

        <div class="col-6 col-sm-6">
              <p>I sat on the idea for a while, as I too often do, but when Apple finally announced support for 3rd-party keyboards, I knew I had to do it &mdash; <strong>I had to try to make mobile typing better for myself and everyone else.</strong></p>
              <p>So while my wife baked in the sun on our kid-free vacation, I sat in the nearby shade designing HERO (which I was calling the Thumbprint keyboard at first, because early versions had more of a thumbprint pattern instead of HERO's circular rings).</p>

          <ul>
              <li>Finger travel is reduced by 35%</li>
              <li>The most-used keys are bigger than on QWERTY</li>
              <li>More characters (eg, @ # -) are always available</li>
              <li>Your recently used symbols and emojis are one tap-hold away</li>
              <li>It was the #7 product when it appeared on Product Hunt.</li>

          <p><strong>Financially, I can't call it a success.</strong> After a couple early blog posts generated two $600 sales days, sales have been sparse.</p>

           <p><strong>Launching your own product is an eye-opening experience that I recommend every designer do.</strong> It forces you to think holistically: Will people buy it? How do I build it? How should I position and market it? Should I run ads? How will I maintain and support it?</p>
            
            <p>This was the first product I launched, so there was a ton of real-world learning through experience, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating an LLC</li>
                <li>Hiring and managing contract development</li>
                <li>Creating an Apple Developer account</li>
                <li>Publishing to the App Store</li>
                <li>App Store rejections and appeals</li>
                <li>Creating App Store graphics</li>
                <li>App Store search optimization</li>
                <li>Customer support</li>
                <li>Marketing and publicity</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I suspected an alternate keyboard would be a tough sell since people are so used to QWERTY, and it didn't help that Apple's 3rd-party keyboard implementation is a bit buggy, so even well-coded keyboard apps crash too often. Also, because system keyboards are built well, people expect their keyboard to work very well, which is hard to do on a shoestring development budget. I think a better development model is to have a dev-partner whose able to provide continuous improvement.</p>
