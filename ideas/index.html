                <h1>Idea sketchbook</h1>
                <p>I like to solve my life's little annoyances, at least theoretically. Sometimes I actually make them into products (I'm working on some new ones now), but the ideas below languish in my sketchbook graveyard. Many are non-digital products (remember I'm an Industrial Design grad) but hopefully they shed some light on how I think. Some are comically old, but still kinda fun.</p>

                    <p>I almost did some freelance work for a scooter startup, and these were a few quick preliminary ideas to solve the problems of rider safety, branding in a competitive market, and city bans due to people leaving scooters in the middle of sidewalks.</p>

                    <p>Our first dog (June) did some dog sports like frisbee and flyball, which means you're often taking your dog on and off the leash (and holding the leash when not using it). "There must be a better way!" I thought, so I designed a retractable collar-mounted leash. <strong>Update:</strong> Somebody ended up making these!</p>

                    <p>Remember how we used alarm clocks before iPhone alarms? And sometimes there'd be an AM/PM screw-up or low-volume error so we wouldn't wake up? It was even riskier using a hotel's unfamiliar alarm clock, so I wanted to design an incredibly intuitive version targeted toward hotels. Since this would be a pretty complex and costly product to manufacture, I never followed through with it, but I iterated a lot and was happy with a solution of using explicit (non multi-modal) buttons tied to explicit displays.

                    <p>When we had our first baby, the usual parenting struggles gave me quite a few ideas! Our first had colic (ie, cries all the time), and the "Happiest Baby on the Block" book taught us that swaddling Christopher should help. Problem was, babies wriggle out of a swaddled blanket, so I designed a simple velcro-based "Cool Swaddle" (basically a baby straight jacket), which worked great. Sadly, I never got the product to market, and eventually someone else did (it's on the stores at WalMart now)...sigh. It's one of my bigger regrets.</p>

                    <p>My small post-pregnant wife struggled to lift the baby in and out of the crib, and drop-side cribs don't seem to work that well (and still require you to bend over), so I came up with this fairly simple push-pedal idea to easily raise the mattress.</p>

                    <p>Some sketches from my senior Industrial Design project. Basically, the idea was to minimize the rigid shell (which is needed to transfer your weight where you want it on your ski) so it's only in the necessary areas, while the rest of the boot can be a soft comfortable pain-free liner. </p>

                    <h2>Easy-ship, easy-assemble modular furniture</h2>
                    <p>In my college and post-college days when I moved every year or so, I thought it'd be nice to have furniture that was very easy to disassemble, move or ship, and reassemble. It could also be modular to fit different spaces, with upholstery that removes easily for washing or replacing to change the look. Now, furniture-rental services are gaining popularity to fill the need, but I still like this concept. (But I have no idea what that shape is on the upper right.)</p>
