For a Packaging Design class, we were asked to design the packaging for a product or product line of  either an existing company or a fictitious company. I chose to invent my own company, Greenball Volleyballs &mdash; a company that sells volleyballs and volleyball equipment. I defined the company's   marketing strategies in the following manner:

<h3>Consumer Benefits:</h3>
<img src="portpics/dot.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="12">High-quality product<br>
<img src="portpics/dot.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="12">Fair price

<h3>Environmental Benefits:</h3>
<img src="portpics/dot.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="12">Set a precedent for a minimalist packaging trend<br>
<img src="portpics/dot.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="12">Minimize our own company's waste

<h3>Special Characteristics of the company:</h3>
<img src="portpics/dot.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="12">Eco-friendly packaging<br>
<img src="portpics/dot.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="12">Durable ball construction<br>
<img src="portpics/dot.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="12">Ability to play with the ball in the store<br>
<img src="portpics/dot.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="12">Youthful but not juvenile image

<h3>Target Market:</h3>
<img src="portpics/dot.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="12">Sand volleyball players<br>
<img src="portpics/dot.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="12">15 to 30 year-olds, mostly males

<h3>Image Statement:</h3>
At the Greenball Volleyball company, you'll be assured that you get what you want out of our sand/outdoor volleyballs because we are run and owned by sand volleyball players just like you.  Our balls are durable because we know how much it sucks to pop a ball one week after you bought it.  We know that you want a soft leather feel &mdash; not the hard plastic slap of some balls.  And best of all, you can try out the ball right in the store before you buy it.  But most importantly, we realize the need to preserve the environment we play in, so we utilize reusable and bare-minimum packaging.


<h3>Appropriate Promotions:</h3>
<img src="portpics/dot.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">Advertise on demographically-similar TV programs:<br>
<img src="portpics/dot.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="18">The Extreme Games<br>

<h3>Logo Ideation:</h3>
<img src="portpics/grnballbw.gif" height="211" width="132" align="right" alt="Black & White and Gray logos">

I attempted to develop a logo that would, upon sight, compel consumers to associate the company logo with: volleyball, environmental responsibility, and a fun youthful image.  The logo also needed to be effective in black and white or gray for newspapers and one-color fliers.

<h3>Final Packaging Solutions:</h3>
My two solutions involved the manufacturer sending a prescribed number of balls to the retailer.  The manufacturer packs the balls flat (airless) to take up less space in the box, thus fewer boxes.  Included in the box are a prescribed number of "stands"  which are not sold when the ball is bought.  The stands are kept and reused by the retailer to minimize waste.  The reasoning behind this concept is that an individually boxed volleyball package is immediately thrown away by the consumer, resulting in many pounds of unnecessary waste.  The retailer is required to inflate the balls to be displayed and set them on their stands.  Most sports equipment retailers have high-powered air pumps that make inflating fast and easy.  Two different concepts evolved for the stand:

<h4>Concept 1:</h4>
A wire coil supports the ball, while an easily-removable sticker on the ball provides the logo, image statement, and  the company's address and phone number.

<h4>Concept 2:</h4>
The ball rests on a simple recycled cardboard ring.  The cardboard is about three inches high, which is enough room for the logo, image statement, and address.  The color is kept in its natural recycled color to indicate the company's environmental responsibility.
