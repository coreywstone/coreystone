I designed and built these speaker stands for a Materials Workshop class that I took before any of my design studios.  Ironically, of all my projects, it's probably my favorite.  I still use them &mdash; together they hold about 124 CDs and support up to about 11"-wide speakers.  Their arced structure improves the viewing angle for the lower racks while also creating an elegant appearance. I've had quite a few people ask me where they can get them!</td>
