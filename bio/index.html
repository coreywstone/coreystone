            <p>I was born in the 70s, my dad a tweed-jacketed Business professor and mom a writer, musician, PFLAG chapter founder, and later got a Counseling degree, but sadly passed away in 2000 before she could use it.</p>

            <p>Growing up in Iowa City, I did lots of drawing, painting, backyard football, gymnastics, skateboarding, and biking.</p>

            <p>My <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0831780/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" target="_blank">brother</a> (now a sound engineer for movies – he did Frozen!) was the real computer wiz, but I used MacDraw to draft putt-putt holes ⛳️ and skate ramps 🛹 to build. I'd spec out the parts list and call for lumber prices. We built 2 ramps and no golf holes, but no one ever told me, "Hey Corey, you're a designer!"</p>

            <p>We moved to Oklahoma in 10th grade, where I did gymnastics and played a lot of sand volleyball and cards with friends. Academically, I did well in both creative and STEM, but I wanted to do something art-related.</p>
            <p>My art teacher recommended the University of Kansas' Fine Arts program, and after filling out the long paper application, I decided I didn't want to do that again, so I went to KU. 💙❤️</p>

          <p>I majored in Industrial Design at KU, where the main design professors' approaches were:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><a href="https://arcd.ku.edu/news/article/2020/02/26/remembering-design-professor-emeritus-richard-branham-alumnus-david-w-hill" target="_blank">Richard Branham</a> was very <strong>user-focused and process-oriented.</strong></li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.idsa.org/profile/ronald-b-kemnitzer/" target="_blank">Ron Kemnitzer</a> was more market-driven: <strong>"What are the benefits and why would someone buy this?"</strong></li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.idsa.org/profile/lance-rake/" target="_blank">Lance Rake</a> stressed the <strong>coolness and uniqueness</strong> of the form and solution.</li>
              </ul>
          <p>Overall, the design-thinking user-centered ID process was perfect prep for digital product design and UX work.</p>

          <p>After KU, we got married and moved to Iowa City for grad school at the U. of Iowa. 🖤💛</p>
          <p>Despite my design professor telling me I should get my master's in Cognitive Science, I got it in Ergonomics / Biomechanics to improve my ability to design physical products. Turns out he was right. He was always right. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
              
              <!--p>For my thesis, I tested the muscle activity and efficiency of finger and postural muscles during slow, normal, and fast typing on a standard keyboard, a "fixed-split" ergonomic keyboard, and Kinesis' Contour keyboard (now discontinued, but similar to <a href="http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/" target="_blank">this</a>). Turns out, there wasn't much difference. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p-->

             <p>In the evenings, Nami and I also coached KU cheer from 2004-2015. At first, I listened to a bunch of leadership books on my Cerner commute, which helped me create motivational systems and a culture of excellence. Might have lost some hearing from Allen Fieldhouse though. 🏀🙉</p>
             <p>My cheer knowledge also inspired many of the apps and services I founded, including the newest one I'm working on now with a dev partner.</p>

              <p>That pretty much brings us to today. The kids are in high school and college, and somehow we currently have 4 dogs (technically, two are/were our older two kids' ESA dogs, but you know how that goes 😔).</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, I'm still designing full-time, working on side projects, and always learning something new. 💡</p>
